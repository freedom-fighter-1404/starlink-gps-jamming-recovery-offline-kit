STARLINK GPS ANTI-JAMMING (OFFLINE) - QUICK START
=================================================

Optional safety (recommended): if you received this kit from an untrusted source,
run `verify_integrity.bat` (Windows) or `./verify_integrity.sh` (macOS/Linux).

If you downloaded a Release ZIP, verify its SHA-256 first (see docs/VERIFY.md).

1) Connect to Starlink Wi‑Fi (same local network as the dish).

2) Run ONE launcher:
   - Windows: START_WINDOWS.bat
   - macOS:   START_MAC.command
   - Linux:   ./START_LINUX.sh

3) Choose "Disable GPS".
   If it becomes enabled again after reboot/updates, choose "Daemon disable" (re-sends every 5 minutes).

4) If "Disable GPS" fails:
   - Choose "Probe" to check connectivity and (if available) whether the live schema includes dish_inhibit_gps.
   - If not supported, use the Starlink app toggle if available, or see:
     docs/OLDER_FIRMWARE.md

No internet is needed. This kit includes grpcurl binaries.
